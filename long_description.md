This app collects current experiences and past memories related to the current New Waverley area in North Canongate, Edinburgh.

Are you a tourist in the area? Have you visited the place in the past? Or is it a destination you'd like to visit in the future? We’d love to hear from you!

This application loads a map of North Canongate, Edinburgh. The goal is simple: find a place or building that is significant to you and add a marker to indicate its position.
Then, write in the Memory Box why this place is significant to you, for example by sharing a story.

This app is part of the [Deep Cities project](https://curbatheri.niku.no/), which studies sustainable urban transformations through heritage. Your memories will be part of a digital inventory of the Canongate area that will be shared with urban planners and heritage experts. Through this app, your voice and values will contribute to future decisions in your city’s development and the maintenance of its heritage.
